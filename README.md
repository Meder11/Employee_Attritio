📊 Employee Attrition Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

This project explores employee attrition using HR data to uncover compensation and satisfaction-related risk factors. Built entirely in Power BI, the dashboard provides a strategic, executive-level view into the drivers of employee turnover.

🔍 Key Insights

😐 These leavers had an average job satisfaction score of 2.47, significantly lower than retained employees.
📉 Employees with low satisfaction and low income represent the highest-risk cluster for attrition.
